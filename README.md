# OPENRNDR JavaScript template project

This is a template project for creating [OPENRNDR](https://openrndr.org/) programs specifically with Kotlin/JS.
For making a standard Kotlin/JVM-based application,
see [openrndr-template](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template).

To get started, run the `browserDevelopmentRun --continuous` Gradle task. This will start a local development server 
with hot-reloading. Any changes you make in `/src/main/kotlin` will be reflected in the browser.
